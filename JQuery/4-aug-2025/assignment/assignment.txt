1. Create a dropdown menu with 3-5 options (e.g., colors or cities).
 - Use the .change() event to show an alert with the selected value.
 
2. Design a button that shows an alert only once, no matter how many times it is clicked.
 - (Hint: Use the .one() method)
 
3. Add three mouse events (mouseenter, mouseleave, click) to a square box (<div>).
 - On hover, change the color.
 - On mouse leave, revert the color.
 - On click, show an alert.
 
4. Create 3 dynamic buttons using jQuery (append them to a container).
 - Use event delegation to handle click events on those buttons.
 - (Hint: Use .on() with a static parent element)
 
5. Create a link (<a>) that opens Google, but use event.preventDefault() to stop the redirection.
 - Show an alert saying “Link blocked!” instead.
